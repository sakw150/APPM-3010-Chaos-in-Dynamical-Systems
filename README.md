# APPM 3010: Chaos in Dynamical-Systems

*The Tipping Point: A Mathematical Model for the Profit-Driven Abandonment of Restaurant Tipping* by Sarah M. Clifton et al introduces a dynamical model that represents tipping behavior. This analysis will explore different conditions to determine how no tipping and equal wage impact restaurant operations. Furthermore, the goal is to explore the model based on the changes in the ratio of quality to service and the fraction of diners, waiters, and cooks. Note that this project utilized the general code proposed by Sarah M. Clifton et al but modifications were made to explore the model. Furthermore, another MATLAB code was generated to plot the modified results. Please contact the authors to access the original MATLAB code for the model. 


This project was based on the paper and model proposed by *The Tipping Point: A Mathematical Model for the Profit Driven Abandonment of Restaurant Tipping* by Sarah M. Clifton et al.
